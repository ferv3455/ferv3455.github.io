title: List of Personal Notes
---

This is a collection of personal notes taken while reading books on programming, algorithms and other topics, practicing coding, and completing projects.

The posts here are migrated from the original blog website [FVSparkles](http://139.196.30.181:8080/) (the server has been shut down since November 10, 2024). The migration is still in progress.
