## Declaring and Calling Functions

- Function definition: `func div(num int, denom int) int { return num / denom }`
  - When multiple input parameters are of the same type, they can be grouped: `(num, denom int)`

### Simulating Named and Optional Parameters

- Go does not have named and optional input parameters.
- Define a struct that has fields that match the desired parameters to emulate this behavior.

### Variadic Input Parameters and Slices

- The variadic parameter is defined using **`...` before the type**: `values ...int`.
  - It must be the last parameter in the parameter list.
  - The variable is a slice of the specified type.
- **A slice may be supplied to a variadic parameter by appending `...` to the slice variable**: `values...`.

### Multiple Return Values

- The types of the return values are listed in parentheses, separated by commas: `(int, int, error)`.
  - By convention, the `error` is always the last value returned.
- **Do not put parentheses around the returned values - that's a compile-time error**.

### Multiple Return Values Are Multiple Values

- The values returned must be assigned to multiple variables at once with `:=` or `=`. **Assigning to a single variable (as in Python) is a compile-time error.**

### Ignoring Return Values

- Ignore one or more return values: use `_` to assign the unused values.
- **Implicitly ignoring all of the return values is allowed.**

### Named Return Values

- Supplying names to return values **pre-declares variables to use within the function to hold the return values**.
  - You must surround names return values with parentheses even if there is only one.
  - **If only some of the return values need names, use `_` to name the remaining return values**.
- The named return parameters only gives a way to **declare an intent** to use variables to hold return values, but **don't require them to be used**.
- Be careful of shadowing named return value variables.

### Blank Returns - Never Use These!

- With named return values, you can use a blank `return` to return the current values of these variables.
  - A `return` is still needed at the end of the function even if it's blank.
- Avoid using blank returns - they make it harder to understand data flow.




## Functions Are Values

- The type of a function is determined by its **signature** - `func`, types of parameters, types of return values.
  - Example: `func(int, int) (int, error)`.
- Functions are values and can be assigned to variables or stored in data structures.
- **The zero value for a function is `nil`.**

> Error handling is what separates the professionals from the amateurs.

### Function Type Declarations

- `type` can be used to define a function type.
  - Functions with the same signature can be assigned to variables of that function type.

### Anonymous Functions

- Only anonymous functions can be declared inside other functions. They can be called immediately (by adding `()` after the function body) or assigned to variables.
- **Anonymous functions are useful for `defer` statements and goroutines**.



## Closures

- Functions declared inside functions are **closures**. They are able to access and modify variables declared in the outer function.
- Closures allow you to limit a function's scope.
- **Closures are useful when passed to other functions or returned from a function. They allow you to use local variables outside of the function.**

### Passing Functions as Parameters

- `sort.Slice` is example of taking a function as a parameter. Passed in as an argument, a closure can **capture** variables from the surrounding function.

```go
sort.Slice(items, func(i, j int) bool {
    return items[i].Value < items[j].Value
})
```

### Returning Functions from Functions

- This is useful for customizing behavior of a function (an example is building middleware for a web server - refer to Chapter 13)



## `defer`

- The cleanup code is attached to the function with the `defer` keyword.
  - **It will be executed on panic, but not on `os.Exit(...)`.**
  - Multiple functions can be deferred in a function. They are executed in **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** order.
  - The code within `defer` closures runs **after** the return statement. **Any variables passed into a deferred closure aren't evaluated until the closure runs.**
  - The deferred function may return values, but they are ignored.

```go
// Ensure file is closed when function exits
f, err := os.Open("file.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer f.Close()
```

- Deferred functions can be used to **examine or modify named return values**. It allows us to take actions based on an error.

```go
// Rollback transaction if an error occurs; otherwise commit it
defer func() {
    if err == nil {
        err = tx.Commit()
    } else {
        tx.Rollback()
    }
}()
```

- **A common pattern in Go is for a function that allocates a resource to also return a closure that cleans up the resource (called a closer).**



## Go Is Call By Value

- Call-by-value: the arguments are always copied into the function's parameters.
- **Maps and slices behave differently: they are implemented with pointers.** Refer to Chapter 6 for details.
