- Learned the key technical means of click farming detection, and acquired necessary knowledge concerning the field of big data including Hadoop, Hive and Spark by participating in real-world projects
- Mastered the principle and application of click farming detection models based on comment content and BERT language model and on customer and seller behavior on the big data platform provided by JD
- Fitted the existing pretrained click farming detection model to a comment dataset of another business scope, mainly by modifying the data processing procedure, and evaluated its performance
- Tested the model with data from the actual production environment, and tuned the configuration parameters used for deployment on the big data platform

- Mastered the implementation and applications of various existing image similarity algorithms, and studied the feasibility of identifying suspected click farming according to image similarity
- Independently developed a click farming detection method based on measuring the abnormal local similarity of comment images with statistic methods and the feature matching algorithm, which yielded an average accuracy of over 95% on experimental synthetic datasets and over 98% on real datasets
- Completed the optimization and environment configuration of the algorithm and deployed it as a scheduled task in the production environment successfully, processing up to 300,000 images per day
