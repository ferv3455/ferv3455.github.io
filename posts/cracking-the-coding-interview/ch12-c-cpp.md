# Chapter 12 C and C++

## Exercises

1. **Last K Lines: print the last K lines of an input file using C++.**

- **How to efficiently purge the oldest line from the array?** Circular array.

2. Reverse String: reverse a null-terminated string.

- Do it in place?

3. **Hash Table vs STL Map: compare and contrast a hash table and an STL map.**

- How is a hash table implemented? Hashing and chaining to handle collisions.
- **How is an STL map implemented?** Binary search tree based on the keys.

4. Virtual Functions: how do virtual functions work in C++?

- What is a virtual table?

5. Shallow vs Deep Copy: what is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy. 

- Values or objects?

6. Volatile: what is the significance of the keyword `volatile` in C?

- In what situation may the value of the `volatile` variable be changed?

7. Virtual Base Class: why does a destructor in base class need to be declared `virtual`?

- When are virtual functions useful?

8. **Copy Node: copy a `Node` data structure recursively. A `Node` may point to two other `Node`s.**

- **How to copy the entire data structure?** Graph traversal with a "visited" set.

9. Smart Pointer: write a smart pointer class.

- How does smart pointers work?

10. Malloc: write an aligned malloc and free function.

- How to manage dynamic memory?

11. 2D Alloc: allocates a two-dimensional array `arr[n][m]`.

- Instead of common practice of allocating `n` blocks of memory, can the entire array be allocated at once?
